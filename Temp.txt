**Problem Statement:**

Ensuring uniformity and consistency in page creation within SharePoint Online presents a challenge due to the absence of readily available templates or master pages across all sites. The lack of standardized templates hinders the maintenance of page standards, resulting in a diverse and potentially disjointed user experience. To address this, our organization has centralized standard templates in a hub site. However, the manual distribution of these templates to individual sites remains a laborious task, impeding site owners and authors from efficiently creating pages with consistent design elements.

**Proposed Solution:**

In response to the challenges posed by the absence of standardized templates, our organization has implemented a proactive solution using a .NET job. This job is designed to automatically create a dedicated "Templates" folder within the "Documents" document library of each SharePoint site. Subsequently, it copies all standard templates stored in the hub site to this newly created folder.

By adopting this automated approach, we empower site owners and authors to seamlessly access and utilize standardized templates for page creation. This not only streamlines the process but also enhances the overall consistency and adherence to page standards across the SharePoint Online environment.

Our strategy aims to improve the user experience, providing a structured framework for page creation that aligns with organizational design standards, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and visually cohesive SharePoint experience.
