**Problem Statement:**

The migration process using tools such as AvePoint and ShareGate has revealed a significant gap in preserving site user groups and permissions during the transition of SharePoint sites. Despite successfully transferring content, the migration tools fall short in copying the intricate usergroup structures and permissions, resulting in a loss of vital access controls for users.

To address this challenge, we have implemented a robust solution involving a .NET job. This job orchestrates the recreation of user groups and the assignment of permissions on a daily basis. Furthermore, the configuration details, including group names and associated permissions, are stored in a central config file. However, an additional issue arises when users delete these groups manually from the site, disrupting the access control continuity.

**Proposed Solution:**

To overcome the limitations of migration tools and ensure the seamless transition of SharePoint sites, our organization has deployed a .NET job dedicated to the creation and maintenance of user groups and permissions. This job, scheduled to run daily, retrieves information from a configuration file containing essential details such as group names and their associated permissions.

Our approach not only rectifies the deficiencies left by migration tools but also addresses the challenge of user-created group deletions. In the event that a group is manually removed from a site, the .NET job detects the absence and reinstates the group along with its specified permissions, ensuring the uninterrupted application of access controls.

By adopting this automated solution, we not only enhance the reliability of our SharePoint environment but also provide a proactive means of preserving user groups and permissions, thereby maintaining the integrity of access controls across our migrated sites.
