**Problem Statement:**

In our organization, the deployment of SharePoint Framework (SPFx) packages across 500+ SharePoint sites has become a labor-intensive task. Managing the deployment of 15+ SPFx packages for each site manually has proven to be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. To streamline this operation, we have implemented a solution where these packages are initially deployed to a hub site. Subsequently, a .NET job is orchestrated to retrieve these packages from the hub site and deploy them uniformly across all associated sites.

**Proposed Solution:**

To alleviate the challenges posed by manual deployment, we have established a centralized hub site for the initial deployment of SPFx packages. This hub serves as a repository for the packages, simplifying the process of managing and updating them. Subsequently, a .NET job has been implemented to automate the distribution of these packages across all 500+ SharePoint sites in our organization.

By adopting this approach, we not only reduce the time and effort required for deployment but also ensure consistency across all sites. This centralized deployment mechanism enhances efficiency, minimizes the risk of human error, and provides a systematic way to scale our SPFx package distribution process.
