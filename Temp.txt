**Problem Statement:**

The creation and management of footer lists across our 500+ SharePoint sites pose a significant challenge. Our footer extension SPFx packages rely on these lists to override universal footer items with site-specific content such as "Contact Us" and "Home Page." Manually creating these lists introduces the potential for human errors, leading to inaccuracies in the displayed footer items. Such errors can result in an inconsistent user experience, as site-specific information may not be appropriately reflected in the footers.

To mitigate these challenges, we have implemented a solution that involves a dedicated .NET job responsible for the automated creation of footer lists on each SharePoint site. This approach aims to eliminate human errors, enhance accuracy, and ensure that the footer content is consistently displayed in alignment with the unique requirements of each site.

**Proposed Solution:**

Our strategy involves leveraging a .NET job to automate the creation of footer lists for each SharePoint site. By implementing this solution, we intend to eliminate the risk of human errors associated with manual list creation. The job will systematically generate and configure the footer lists, ensuring that the necessary site-specific items, such as "Contact Us" and "Home Page," are accurately reflected in the footers.

This automated approach not only reduces the likelihood of discrepancies in the displayed footer content but also streamlines the overall process of managing site-specific information. By centralizing list creation through the .NET job, we aim to enhance the reliability and consistency of our footer extension SPFx packages across the entire SharePoint environment.
